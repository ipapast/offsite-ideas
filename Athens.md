# Activities

- [Railbiking tour in Megara (40km from Athens)](https://www.rail-biking.com/tours) - I've heard really good things about this. It's slow, you don't really need to know how to ride a bike as it's seated. You ride in pairs, with stops for photos. Great views of the coastline, 7km one way and then back. Guides are included and can be booked privately.
